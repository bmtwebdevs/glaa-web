                A licence is needed for any work carried out in the UK, even if the business is located overseas.
                All workers, temporary or permanent are covered by the licensing scheme.
                Read our What if my business is not based in the UK?
                page for more information on supplying workers if your business is overseas.
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading-medium">Exemptions from the scheme</h2>

                Read the Exclusions page for more details on the work that does not require a licence.
